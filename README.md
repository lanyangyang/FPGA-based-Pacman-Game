# FPGA-based-Pacman-Game

## Intro
In this game, there are monsters, player, pac-dots and walls. User will use 4 buttons to control player eat all dots without caught by the monster. Four digits 7-segment display is used to show the score. There are two game levels in my design. The clearance condition is to eat all the dots. The following figure shows these two levels and all the game elements.
